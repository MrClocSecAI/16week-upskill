# 16-Week Upskill Program: From Pentester to AI Security Engineer

## Purpose
This 16-week program is designed to transform me into an AI Security Engineer, blending cybersecurity certifications (CEH v13, Security+) with hands-on pentesting and AI development skills. My goals are:
1. **Certifications**: Pass CEH v13 and Security+ to establish a strong cybersecurity foundation.
2. **Career Shift**: Transition from QA/A+ roots to an AI Security Engineer role, securing ML systems and APIs.
3. **Salary Boost**: Target $120K-$150K+ with a GitHub portfolio showcasing practical work.
4. **Real-World Experience**: Master pentesting via Hack The Box (HTB), TryHackMe (THM), HackerOne, and huntr.com—focusing on AI/ML vulnerabilities.

This plan leverages my existing skills (A+ cert, QA experience, Python basics) and builds a bridge to AI security through practical labs, vuln hunting, and structured learning.

## Where We’ve Been (Weeks 1-2 Recap)
- **Week 1 (March 10-15, 2025)**:  
  - Built `log_list_v1.py` (log parser), hardened SSH on .101 (key-only), found XSS in Flask on .104, ran Nmap scans (.101/.104).  
  - Tied OmniGPT breach and Flask vulns to AI risks—API hardening focus emerged.  
- **Week 2 (March 17-21, 2025)**:  
  - Upgraded to `log_list_v2.py` (CSV export), enumerated SSH/SMB on .104, rate-limited SSH with IPTables, researched AI poisoning on X, ran Netcat recon (.101/.104), set up Git/GitHub.  
  - Key insights: Poisoning federated learning (15% accuracy drop) and synthetic data (GAN backdoors) are real threats—QA mindset (data validation) applies; Git tracks progress for portfolio.

## Where We Are (End of Week 2, March 21, 2025)
- **Current State**:  
  - Completed Friday’s tasks: Netcat recon on .101/.104 (banners logged), Git installed on .101, `16week-upskill` repo live at https://github.com/MrClocSecAI/16week-upskill.  
  - VMs: .101 (Ubuntu_AI, key-only SSH), .102 (Kali, attack box), .104 (Ubuntu_Target, password SSH vuln).  
  - Next: Saturday (March 22)—reflect on Week 2, plan Week 3 poisoning sim (scikit-learn).  
- **Progress**: Phase 1 (Recon & Basics) on track—recon/enumeration skills (Nmap, Hydra, Netcat) and AI threat awareness solid, Git portfolio started.

## Where We’re Going (Weeks 2-16 Plan)

    - Insight: Git tracks progress, enables huntr.com fixes—key for AI Security Engineer role.
  - Netcat Recon:
    - From .102: `nc -v 192.168.56.101 22` – Banner: [SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.6p1], key-only confirmed. Result: "192.168.56.101: inverse host lookup failed: unknown host (UNKNOWN) [192.168.56.101] 22 (ssh) open".
    - From .102: `nc -v 192.168.56.104 22` – Banner: [SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.6p1], password auth active. Result: "192.168.56.104: inverse host lookup failed: unknown host (UNKNOWN) [192.168.56.104] 22 (ssh) open".
    - Insight: Both .101 and .104 run OpenSSH 9.6p1—port 22 open, no DNS resolution (lab norm). .101 secure with key-only, .104 vuln to password attacks (e.g., Hydra). CEH recon skill—banner grabbing and port status confirmed.

This is our blueprint—let’s crush Week 2’s end and charge into AI security!
