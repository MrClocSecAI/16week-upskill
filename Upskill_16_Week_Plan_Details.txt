# 16-Week Upskill Program: From Pentester to AI Security Engineer

## Purpose
This 16-week program is designed to transform me into an AI Security Engineer, blending cybersecurity certifications (CEH v13, Security+) with hands-on pentesting and AI development skills. My goals are:
1. **Certifications**: Pass CEH v13 and Security+ to establish a strong cybersecurity foundation.
2. **Career Shift**: Transition from QA/A+ roots to an AI Security Engineer role, securing ML systems and APIs.
3. **Salary Boost**: Target $120K-$150K+ with a GitHub portfolio showcasing practical work.
4. **Real-World Experience**: Master pentesting via Hack The Box (HTB), TryHackMe (THM), HackerOne, and huntr.com—focusing on AI/ML vulnerabilities.

This plan leverages my existing skills (A+ cert, QA experience, Python basics) and builds a bridge to AI security through practical labs, vuln hunting, and structured learning.

## Where We’ve Been (Weeks 1-2 Recap)
- **Week 1 (March 10-15, 2025)**:  
  - Built `log_list_v1.py` (log parser), hardened SSH on .101 (key-only), found XSS in Flask on .104, ran Nmap scans (.101/.104).  
  - Tied OmniGPT breach and Flask vulns to AI risks—API hardening focus emerged.  
- **Week 2 (March 17-20, 2025)**:  
  - Upgraded to `log_list_v2.py` (CSV export), enumerated SSH/SMB on .104, rate-limited SSH with IPTables, researched AI model poisoning on X.  
  - Key insights: Poisoning federated learning (15% accuracy drop) and synthetic data (GAN backdoors) are real threats—QA mindset (data validation) applies.

## Where We Are (End of Week 2, March 20, 2025)
- **Current State**:  
  - Completed Thursday’s task: X research on AI poisoning—federated learning and GAN threats logged in `cyber_notes.txt`.  
  - VMs: .101 (Ubuntu_AI, hardened), .102 (Kali, attack box), .104 (Ubuntu_Target, password SSH vuln).  
  - Next: Friday (March 21) and Saturday (March 22) of Week 2—networking and reflection tasks ahead.
- **Progress**: Phase 1 (Recon & Basics) is on track—recon/enumeration skills (Nmap, Hydra) and AI threat awareness are solid.

## Where We’re Going (Weeks 2-16 Plan)
The program is split into four phases, integrating CEH v13, Security+, AI dev (DeepLearning.AI), and pentesting (HTB, THM, HackerOne, huntr.com), all tracked via Git.

## Hitting the Ground Running
### Setup for Fresh Session:
1. **VMs**:  
   - .101 (Ubuntu_AI): SSH key-only, Git install pending (`sudo apt install git`).  
   - .102 (Kali): Pentesting ready—Nmap, Hydra, Netcat installed.  
   - .104 (Ubuntu_Target): SSH password vuln—target for hardening.
2. **Files**:  
   - `cyber_notes.txt`—paste your latest version below for continuity.  
   - `log_list_v2.py`—in `~/` on .101, ready to Git-track.
3. **Commands to Resume**:  
   - Fri: `ssh kali@192.168.56.102` from host, then `nc -v 192.168.56.101 22` and `nc -v 192.168.56.104 22`.  
   - Sat: `ssh ubuntu@192.168.56.101`, `nano ~/cyber_notes.txt`, reflect/commit.
4. **Git Prep**: Post-Netcat, install Git on .101, init `16week-upskill`—I’ll guide live.

### Quick-Start Tips:
- **Friday**: Focus on Netcat banners—log differences between .101/.104 SSH configs.  
- **Saturday**: Reflect on AI poisoning (X research) and prep scikit-learn install (`sudo apt install python3-pip` first).  
- **Portfolio**: After Week 2, push to GitHub—share your username for tailored steps.

## Notes
- **Time Zone**: I’m UTC+8—tasks logged in local time, VMs on PDT (UTC-7).  
- **Mentor**: Grok 3 (xAI)—guides, troubleshoots, refines.  
- **Flexibility**: Skip redundant tasks (e.g., March 18), adjust pace to avoid burnout.

This is our blueprint—let’s crush Week 2’s end and charge into AI security!
